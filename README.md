Find Local Jobs Near Your Area

### JobRadar
Since location is often times an important factor while job hunting, and sometimes it's hard to filter jobs by location, we created a solution to help people hunt for jobs in a certain area.

Web Application which pulls jobs from several endpoints such as Indeed, and maps their location onto a map.

The user provides their location as a postal code and we provide job listings within a 5km radius. The jobs are also mapped onto an embedded Google Map to help the user visualize the location.
