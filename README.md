Find Local Jobs Near Your Area

### JobRadar
Location is often times an important factor while job hunting, but it's usually hard to filter jobs by location. Time is wasted looking for jobs that are too far of a commute, so we created a solution to help people hunt for jobs in a certain area.

Web Application which pulls jobs from several endpoints such as Indeed, and maps their location onto a map.

The user provides their location as a postal code and we provide job listings within a 5km radius. The jobs are also mapped onto an embedded Google Map to help the user visualize the location.
